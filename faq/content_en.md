### How the /mute command works
When changing user perms in a channel (disabling the "Speak" option) within the Discord platform, the changes take effect after reconnecting to the voice channel. Thus, when the /mute command is called, the user’s perms are updated, and the user is transferred to the server’s AFK channel (if there is one) or disconnected.

### How the /invite command works
When you call the /invite command, the perms of the invited user are updated. If a channel is blocked, he can now still connect to the chat. After which an attempt is made to send a message to DM. If the operation fails, the caller of the command is provided with an invitation link.

### To whom will the bot transfer rights to the channel if the current owner leaves it?
RC2 will request the current list of users connected to the channel and transfer rights to the first of them.

### I am the creator of the channel, but not the current owner. How to get my ownership back?
To do this, just use the “Transfer Ownership" button or type the /ownership command.

### Prime status suddenly disappeared. Possible reasons?
1. There are problems with the payment method on [Boosty](https://boosty.to/dsroomcreator)/[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/roomcreator2).
2. You left our [support server](https://roomcreator2.info/community), and at the same time they lost the role that provided Prime status.
3. If the subscription is completed, but the role is not issued, you need to reconnect your Discord account in your personal account on Boosty/Patreon.
